# How I workerd on this project

     -My purpose in doing this study was to check what I learned. I thought of doing a small multi-component study and
      details helped me understand what I have learned and simulate the process of preparing a project
      a little. I observed what I did well and what I needed to improve.
      
     -Before I started working, I took the app apart and went through it step-by-step. This helped 
     me to work in a controlled and orderly manner.
     -I build this app  based on JavaScript/React.js
     -I created a Product List as JSON file. After that i put all these products in other components and I mirrored the products on the local server using various event loops.
     -When i want to choose specific options .I used JavaScript array and math() features.
     -I used Responsive and other CSS features when necessary for the design.
     -I managed DOMs with events.

# If I had more time I would add and change this 

     -I could add events along with more effective designs to fill the screen.
     -I could create an input or category to filter products.
     -I could be more careful with color harmonies.
